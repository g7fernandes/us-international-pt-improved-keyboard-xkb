// This layout is intended to make easier to type ã that is the most frequent
// accentuation in the portuguese language. Still it need combination of 3 keys
// to be inserted.
// The ã and õ were inserted under the vacant level3 of the keys
// <F> and <G>. The ç was inserted under the level3 of the key of the letter
// <C> like in the Macintosh layout since it is more accessible there.
// The ç under the level3 of the key <,> was kept so people used to us(intl)
// will still find it there. The 'copyright' and 'cent' chars were moved to
// the level3 of <X>.
// Although 'õ' is less common then 'ê', putting it under <G level3> makes
// easier to memorize and type the common combination 'çõ'.
// Dead keys moved to level3 like in AltGr US International
// by Gabriel Fernandes Silva
